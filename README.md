# Mercury-Regrograde
Highway Fatal Crash Statistics Data Analysis Project
I need to be able to determine the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for each variable (number of crashes, number of vehicles, number of fatalities) for nine different speeds of Mercury. I also need to know the p value for each of these measurements to determine the statistical significance of the deviations. 

Using data from 1995 – 2004 ONLY (Average of 102–105 crashes per day)
Analyze the standard deviation from the mean for each of the nine Mercury speeds. Sort the speeds in this order:
xFD, FD, SD, xSDr, xSRr, SR, FR, xSRd, xSDd
I need to evaluate each speed and know the standard deviation above or below the mean for the variable being considered (in this case, just the number of crashes). Each record/date in the database is a single crash incident.
