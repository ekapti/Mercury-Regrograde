# Mercury-Retrograde
This is a simple analysis (t-test) of the effects of Mercury retrograde on highway accidents and fatalities. 

Using data from 1995 – 2004 ONLY (Average of 102–105 crashes per day)
Analyze the standard deviation from the mean for each of the nine Mercury speeds. Sort the speeds in this order:
xFD, FD, SD, xSDr, xSRr, SR, FR, xSRd, xSDd
I need to evaluate each speed and know the standard deviation above or below the mean for the variable being considered (in this case, just the number of crashes). Each record/date in the database is a single crash incident.
